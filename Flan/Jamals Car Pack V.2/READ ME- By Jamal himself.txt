Since i wanted to be nice i have uploaded V. 2.0 of my car pack in the old beta stage since I feel a big delay has been on. Alot more things will be included in V. 3.0+(1.7.10) such as updated models. Also my guns will be included in this pack in V. 3.0. 2 people have helped me along with this process. 1st Half Coder: Oskiinus. 2nd Half Coder: PokerMorda. 3rd Half Coder: Yunuscracke. The 650S was made by Oskiinus but was edited slightly by me. The new version comes in little updates. Color Versions will also be avaliable soon for all cars.
If this pack is put up for money contact me at: Jamalforzamotorcraft@gmail.com. Alot of cool things are too come. ALSO BIG KUDOS TO MY perfect tester: Hoper25. OK I i have talked enough now enjoy this pack.(again)
